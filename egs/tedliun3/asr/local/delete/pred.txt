okay so let 's review a farm that doesn 't feed its animals
to do that don 't look
he 's a biologist
we 're not realists us food is
ok a farm that doesn 't feed its fish
a farm that measures its success
any in the process miguel and this company
so i just started playing
whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle
chemical contaminants pesticide runoff
let 's start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves
i first aided at a restaurant in southern spain
here he 's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite
what we need for one of these
look at their valleys pink they 're fisting
someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there
there is no feed
at the only true disability
that 's the one that relies on two billion years
what they find a story <unk>unk<unk>
he looked at me like i just quoted a whitney houston song
it was more like a passionate affair <unk>unk<unk>
but it hadn 't
a fish farm that also a bird sanctuary
there 's my boss and
this is
one has come from music
i don 't care if it 's the secretary of hs
to soak up impurities and then he added
let 's call him mcgill actually his name is mcgill
of american agriculture we should call what it is
approaches in asking the question
about the farm sustainability absolutely i said
the mineral needs of phytoplankton
and then there is a remembering self
that 's fantastic i love big for cbr
pointing out like this
the system is so healthy it purifies the water
it came to the table a bright
if you get into that situation it 's like
private bird sanctuaries in all of europe
farms that aren 't worlds under themselves
none of the ginco fraud
that the fish are eating what the beating in the wild <unk>unk<unk>
so it 's not just about the words
we type we file we go to dinner it 's fun
the waste from our fish gets distributed
everybody talks about happiness these days
every are slogging through the wetland
that first one was
thank you i 'm going to pass you here
he said no they do it because the food 's better
we point at the algae <unk>unk<unk>
and a farm that measures its success
and it 's never produced anything really good to eat
that 's a bit too radical
we farm extensively
or basically a world onto ourselves
like you were taking a bite of the ocean
and ecologically it was exacer
and that night i was lying in bed and i thought
it 's at the tip of the guatemala cavear river
right i said got off the phone
and he said there 's just too much chicken in the world
of on the job experience
i 'm an expert in relationships
of your feed is chicken
and then he 's off
and when it works its way through the system
thank you but
almost simmering white color
is that accurate tar like flavor
i have young filmmakers
it was a beautiful fish
not by pumps but by fresh water
defeat itself
a lot of arguments against it
there is a long pause on the line
who can make a fish taste good
and then i realized when he says
what the hell is a sustainable protein
where lovers
i was there not long ago with me go
now he 's mentioning
its ideology is not science
that looked out there pretty good
like we clear cut forests
flavorful textured
dark urine dark
this is an ecological network
how do you measure success
and if i 'm going to be really honest
there wasn 't any canal ope
it 's successed by the health of its predators
do they do that for the children
because this love story
only work up some blood for you
so you can feel good about selling it
so let me give you a little peak
that right well it 's come before
and the health of its predators
there are better chef than i 'll ever be
it 's such a rich system
by the success of its predators
and not just for those fish
's about thirty percent he said
no i 'm serious
set up pushing water out
there was a company trying to solve
i fell out of love with this fish
and i said
it tasted sweet and clean
it 's a different kind of love story <unk>unk<unk>
and so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two
that our experts in flavor too
because they 're the ones
fish farms pollute
not intensively
we mentioned some algaes
if you 're
we goes on to tell me
how do we keep fish on our menus
nice one
this second fish
thinking in a two percent
one billion people
and ted are
i don 't know anything about fish
and here in the surprise
so here finally
after it 's been overcooked
it 's the romantic kind
he should have said no he said
but for a lot of people
and one of the most important
let 's call him down to
that success he said
is an amazing guy
feed grain arab avores
thank you thank you
a sort of
yes he said
she kind of set us up
credible you know
a business in liquidation
okay
thank you telecoming
sixty thousand
i said dawn
no kidding
another gut
if this doesn 't work
sixty thousand
yeah i don 't
actually am
and who
the
thank you
so
and
place on him that i shamelessly stole from chelists so please for you
until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist
and that is an escape from historical state <unk>unk<unk>
one day the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event
now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half
you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark year and i 'm totally with you
you might want to say so you still have a gun this ridiculous time machine and go for it
now the experiencing self lives its life
most of them do anyway and they 're inefficient take tuna a major drawback
not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land
i asked them how it became such an expert on fish said fish
every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the far
because if that 's the future of good food it 's going to be delicious thank you
have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic
but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean i 'm a journalist
they did it by draining land they built this intricate series of canals
with a better story about his experience
it 's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution
i 'm going to talk today about energy and climate
feasting i was totally confused i said mcgill aren 't they feasting on your fish
until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the argentinians
that 's not a business and is agriculture <unk>unk<unk>
monoculture we don 't want giant fields of the same thing that 's wrong
because of gross inequalities in distribution not touch
not concentrated and then he added
relatives to how much i think of other vacations and
and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count
beautiful music and the source was a man
well it seems to me that this issue well or it should be
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure
you need to accept the proof and we 're not that good at doing that
i almost never cook with it <unk>unk<unk>
dawn i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins
curiosity also manifested itself in in
pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil check into fish
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score
come up to me and say give me some advice for doing this
and i love think flamingos how you don 't see the world
they were exactly like the people in this room
so not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals not just a farm that measures the health
and let me begin with one example
were the question and answer session after one of my lectures
you might say it 's arrested for the future of good food
but what are you fish eating and what 's the feed conversion ratio
architects and engineers thankfully and
killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place are the lot of birds
now the remembering self
too many chemicals pesticides hormones
three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile done the
they use the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals
me go do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm
drop in the ocean i know but i 'll take it and so should you
chernobyl bopal the challenger
what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish
let 's call him done <unk>unk<unk>
is that something that you can share since you do have a few moments left now
a canachian little economation little antioxidant to get you going
was a company trying to do it right i want to disappoint them
farms that
last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it
that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul ausset
here 's what happened <unk>unk<unk>
now essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick
unlike any fish for elegant farm i 'd ever been at
i 've loved only too <unk>unk<unk>
ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals
you know i 'm okay with that
think about that it 's an incredible fact and why is it true
will go hungry today one billion that 's more than ever before
however romantic is also instructive
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months
and leaves the water it 's cleaner than when it entered
what 's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs
and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets
they raised beef gattle on what was essentially wetlands
by a tragic of fliction with paranoid schizophrenia <unk>unk<unk>
and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night
and this is a bit how to dressify a thing <unk>unk<unk>
and all along agribusiness has simply asked
who lives in the present <unk>unk<unk>
all and by the way those flamingos they shouldn 't even be there in the first place
they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish farm
so i 've known a lot of fish in my life <unk>unk<unk>
but a farm that 's literally a water purification plant
completely reversed the ecological distruction
instead let 's look to the ecological model
it 's not even an idea it 's a process
's a chicken poet he said yeah feather skin
i mean you know you can choose your list
we talk about local food we eat organic
so after this amazingly fun conversation
but one thing will happen they will think they are happier <unk>unk<unk>
i don 't remember the statistic nanosphere but the point is
they reverse the flow of water they literally flip the switch
being satisfied with people that we like
if we 're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be
kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish
what does that have to do with the placebo effect well
and all i can say about this is
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
well they couldn 't make it work not economically
but i was in love and my head
there is a genuine question <unk>unk<unk>
said what percentage
how much did these patients think they suffered
but our water has no imperities
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river
and ever evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time
some fewer still have come from business <unk>unk<unk>
it ruined the whole experience
i think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey
and i 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok <unk>unk<unk>
now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase in of co2
is an option but fear is not thank you
later that day i was driving around this property with me go and i asked him i said for a place it seems so natural
now i 'd like to start with an example of somebody
now the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
and no he didn 't cook the fish and he 's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand it
i know do the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it 's as amazing
are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don 't love that question
and in the next decade we 're going to have another billion gamers who are externally good
an impact that the assault from these words unleashed
it turns out mcgel spent the better part of his career in the makomi national park in africa <unk>unk<unk>
here in the states it 's separating students from a b cd and so on
so for better for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be part of our future
people in the back are people on video years from now watching this ago well yeah that looks kind of neat and
and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self
which was delicious and i don 't like fish skin i don 't like it seared i don 't like it crispy
and if and if you would choose a different vacation
or better how can we create conditions that enable every community
previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it
i thought i 'd love it this fish because i swear to got after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken
i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully i fall as well
two point five to one great two point five what were you feeding sustainable proteins he said
it 's hard to overstate the destruction <unk>unk<unk>
and for nathaniel music brought him back into a fold of friends
i didn 't mention the skin of my beloved fish
and maintains the story of our life and it 's the one that the doctor
vast moment shrimp eel
i can but this guy can 't <unk>unk<unk>
it 's cruel to millions of people it 's absolutely astonishing cold
i 'm panting and sweating i 'm mud up to my knees and mcgill is commonly conducting a biology lecture
the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy
now i don 't love this question because it 's the term in the logic of our food system for the last fifty years
it was filmmaking and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
at vetilla pama it 's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain
i said mcgill isn 't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm
is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you 've done a task
i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked in me go i said
and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of the
well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that
that what happens during these moments of experience is our life
despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world
some have come from natural sciences <unk>unk<unk>
thank you so much now when we were on the phone a few weeks ago
it 's the finite resource that we are spending well we are on the earth <unk>unk<unk>
the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company
for the past fifty years we 've been fishing the seas
i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you
they would ask around well i got on the phone and a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer <unk>unk<unk>
media the best seller on the menu what a fish
but now because the reflective self is in charge <unk>unk<unk>
not because i 'm some self righteous goody too shoes foody
so river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days
that 's something the world needs right now thank you
that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it 's horrible
the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here 's a fact
not like miami game designer i 'm exuberant but he says he says
the most mindless epidemic were in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between
we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds
bone meal scraps dried and processed in defeat
but since it didn 't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jennie macarthy
and when you get there you 're shocked to discover what you 're truly capable of that synepic wint
we love farmers ' markets we love small family farms
i mean first of all can you give a sense of what sort of scale of investment this is
viox weapons of mass destruction hanging chads
no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world
spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do
more than two hundred and fifty different species it 's become today the largest
and they gave up after about forty and there were many more
that 's been the motivation it 's been the justification it 's been the business plant
feed convergent ratio two point five to one he said best in the business
not very sustainable it doesn 't taste very good either <unk>unk<unk>
it 's ugly it 's beneath us and we really have to stop it
it 's vanished we vanished it puff in the rich world
the farm 's incredible i mean you 've never seen anything like this
and interestingly enough bono is also ted prize winner
is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic
farmers that are not just producers but experts and relationships
not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the seat one of you the world
this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health
seeing if it works changing it when it doesn 't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that 's the good news
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly
i 'd like to leave you with a poem by the 14th century persian poet named hospice
i wrote a story about genetically engineered food the same thing only bigger people were going crazy so
a canadian fraud a kay i don 't even know what that is but we 're spending billions of dollars on it it 's fraud
then i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of wetter and buffalo new york and
i know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a strain i moved on and soon after that
the flaming goes eat the shrimp the shrimp beat the phytoplankton so the pink of the belly the better the system
that really is beyond beyond beyond our imagination nature 's imagination is so
oh that guy and of course actually
it 's good for the world or because we 're supposed to but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this was in the late ' 60s
you end up in taboo in becky south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting
and treating them so i think
there 's a lot that has to come together so this is a wish it 's a very concrete wish that
there are questions in problems with the people we used to believe we 're always right so be skeptical
a business that 's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
which are various techniques that would delay the heating to bias twenty or thirty years to get iraq together
and here he sees a grouping pattern there are minds him of the tanzanian giraffe
and i was getting very interested in space science as well again it 's the science fiction influence as a kid
to one thing gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals
by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
they brew it in a town one hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building this
few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania <unk>unk<unk>
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope you 're looking forward to that thank you very much
crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system these are world records that are on this as well
so according to rotitus they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom wide policy <unk>unk<unk>
people are recognizing that they are to be thinking of policy when of happiness when they think of public policy
you 're right let 's fix it it 's true we 've got a huge food problem that this isn 't science
when we looked at how we have feelings very within come <unk>unk<unk>
the second factor is the services we use this encompasses everything the food we
than the one weekification because there are no new memories added you have not trained the story <unk>unk<unk>
thank you i 'm sit to understand more about about terapower right <unk>unk<unk>
and they 're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we 're going away to
and important to be done and there are also tons of collaborators everywhere you go hundreds of thousands of people
some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be seen as a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding
the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next fears thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics
we 're going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i 'm concerned
restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively
and i thought wow i 'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool
and i can twist that around i 'm sorry if you 're getting queasy you look away don 't look at the <unk>unk<unk>
she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way find <unk>unk<unk>
and because a very critical part of the stories how it ends
and some of them worked in some of it didn 't we go rid of the stuff that didn 't now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risks
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed <unk>unk<unk>
that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles months in rubella vaccine shot
so i started to think about what these games are making us virtuos is that here are the four things i came up with
so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let 's look at how different teams perform
the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down <unk>unk<unk>
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now
he just developed a road of virus vaccine with a bunch of other people it 'll save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand
but in our games sort of just having five people on the dream team we said everybody 's on the dream team and it 's your job
getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time
reported a story and that was a story he said he had been listening to a symphony <unk>unk<unk>
in the fact that whenever i wasn 't in school i was out in the woods hiking and taking
i had somebody counted the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use
we go on vacations to a very logic stent in the service of our remembering self
but done the whole american endeavor is about life liberty the pursuit of happiness
well i suspect i speak a bar for most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true thank you so much
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is that they 're really different
for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds in the real world now
there weren 't christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years
yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fiskin
in terms of big scale possible game changes this is the biggest that you 're aware about there
it doesn 't have nutrients it doesn 't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now
drowning in data what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down
i don 't care that it doesn 't put out co2 i kind of wish it did put out co2 but i guess all except because it 's cheaper
to thoroughly trash this globe portable water arable land rainforest oil gas they 're going away
and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on top they run out of a time and what happens it 's a crisis
now who 's normal there 's no normal there 's common there 's typical
there are a number of people who 'd have a lot more o moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
by age say forty years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about
so finally the last game we 're launching it march third this is a game done with the world bank institute if you complete the game you will be
ask questions demand proof demand evidence don 't take anything for granted but here 's the thing when you get proof
and i think here in the ted group we have many people who are already pursuing this
i 'm telling a story that many of you know because steve 's calms became the basis for a book which was turned into a movie
biggest wiki in the world second biggest wiki in the world with nearly eighty thousand articles is the world of warcraft wiki
our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports that illustrate it ever produced
and that constraint has to do with co2 co2 is warming the planet
it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity in our innate ability to imagine
the u238 it is kind of a crazy idea in fact people had talked about it for a long time
that really flip me out it turns out though that that 's not even where it stops if you have capsules
it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let 's be honest we 're at a point in this world
and remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess above the notion of happiness <unk>unk<unk>
don 't pretend it isn 't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone takes their vitamins this morning
find out that they 're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that
that has to do with a gain later and as somewhat uncertain painting in fact the ipcc report that
they divided the entire kingdom in half they played one dice game and the winners of that game got to go
gamers always believe that an epic one is possible and then it 's always worth trying and trying now gamers don 't sit around
things that have a potential to be far less expensive if the trait off you get into is let 's make energy superin super
stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
to invent the future of energy the future of food the future of health the future of security and the future of the social safety net
this is an example of how adults and positions of power can ignite the power of a child
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it 's held so tightly in places that i can shake it
very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it 's an a serious issue
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world 's most urgent problems in fact
and i turn around and this is older man i have no idea who he is and i said i 'm sorry sorry i don 't
that 's back from high school algebra but let 's let 's take a look first we 've got population
and you 've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off because now you have endowed patient a
then what do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth 's table <unk>unk<unk>
of all the energy and so in fact we need a big breakthrough here something that 's going to be
disabled agitives crippled helpless useless rect
most of them don 't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self
they do that because they 're able to follow the broken white line of highway eight hundred and ninety two
even better it was farmraised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability
was its catalyst and nathaniel 's manic rage
china brazil can get online they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade so brings up to one point five billion gamers
of energy gather in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant this is energy farming <unk>unk<unk>
repurposed multiple times and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data so
merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was
all day doesn 't china every day and likewise the wind doesn 't blow all the time and so if you depend on these sources
please don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now
to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well <unk>unk<unk>
minute of pain that patient a had patient be had and more but now there is another question
is really very deadening and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next
will be hard but the toughest one here is this long term issue who 's going to be sure who 's going to guarantee
and if i want to step back and look at everything i can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history
unfortunately that 's all the good news because there 's some other problems and they 've been mentioned many times and one of them is that
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos and somehow people enjoyed that
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical a chemical reaction for which my playing the music
we don 't want companies patenting life we don 't want companies owning seeds and you know my response to all of that is yes
so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
taking something fake and making it into something real i 'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage
i understand it i do understand it because who moved anyone have measles here does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles <unk>unk<unk>
can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live
i have that sense that when we go onvocations this is very frequently the case that is that it 's
one day los angeles times call him a steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard
and through our artistic lens through our creativity we 're able to shape those emotions into reality
which is something i love or i could pick that this thing that 's half the cost with no co2 gets invented
and so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world
you know i was already bargaining at the five year old child with dr p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
for this number to go up in the rich world perhaps the top one billion we probably could cut back and use less but every year
doesn 't matter it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real
this eighty percent reduction that really is very important that we get there and that twenty percent will be used up by
the disaster is for that two billion an even onboard has changed his stick now is why isn 't the r & d
the one that chooses the one that has the memory that is less bad and that 's the the surgeon that will be chosen
from let 's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games until we solve real world problems now i know you 're asking
the modular people that 's a different approach there 's a liquid type reactor which seems a little hard that maybe they say how about us
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of lives of independence and you 've been making a liar atomy ever since
and it 's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it 's just a number 's game and they 're not just going to die of needles what about polio let 's have that
because when they think about it they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio
they play dice games for eighteen years we 've been playing workout for sixteen years i say we are ready for our own epic game now
lazy that you 'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you i 'm not sure that 's why it 's given the importance of the problem but
and you 'll get an amnesic drug so that you won 't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation
laughter you know i went in and pitched to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it 's going to be this epic romance passionate
why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti ink
and soul denning to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms a big placebo
at the agribusis model for the future it 's really old and it 's tired it 's high on capital chemistry and machines
chicagory index finger being there and then when i close my finger the same thing as i move back
i mentioned that to me gallon he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it 's the last offense before anything enters the body it evolved
although it 's great they don 't require fuel they have some disadvantages one is that the density
if people took seriously that finding it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about
was transformed into understanding a quiet curiosity and in grace <unk>unk<unk>
so much greater in the nuclear space there are other innovators we don 't know there work as well as we know this one but
now i have planned for this and it entails convincing more people including all of you to spend more time
mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there 's never been a time like this my great grandparents
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i 've
there 'd better be it there 'd better be a nine in the beginning of my death number but it 's not even about people like us because
so the next day just before the of that i called dan i said dan what are some examples of sustainable proteins i said even no

who likewise if their science goes well if they funding for their plant pilot plants goes well that they can compete for this and it 's best at multiple succeed because then you can use a mix of these things we certainly need one to succeed
it really got them involved in the idea you know there are people who live in the mosquito so with that energy i like to come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies
and so that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with with islam we created the liquid metal
and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time and that if you had asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn 't have hesitated for a second
there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical sact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled
the microprocessor is a miracle the personal computer 's a miracle the internet and its services are a miracle so the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles usually we don 't have a deadline
that 's a lot of time to spend playing games maybe too much time considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world but actually according to my research at the institute for the future it 's actually the opposite is true
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time so there 's re deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real

we need to get the message up we need to have this dialogue be a more rational more understandable dialogue including the steps that the government takes this is an important wish but it is one i think we can achieve thank you
blissful productivity i love it you know there 's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for twenty two hours a week kind of a half time job it 's because we know when we 're playing a game that we 're actually happier working hard than we are
the industrial revolution and even in the 1900s we 've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity that 's why we have refrigerators air conditioning we can make modern materials and do so many things
fifty years we 're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent this is investment in africa over the last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we 're not giving it to them and why
and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes are remembering self from our experiencing cell time has very little impact on the story
pop right back into a specific section now the reason why this is important is because by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way i can look at in my entire browsing history in the exact same way so i can drill into what i 've done
what i 'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible so what we 're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age this
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps those applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness i mean the place of scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we 're just as messed up as anybody else 's
to post videos to post photos we piloted this game with one thousand seven hundred players in two thousand and seven and we 've tracked them for the three years since and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience nobody wants to change how they live just because

this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawn comic books and so on so filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that
the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution which is an extraordinary thing but it 's also act because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games we 're actually changing
two thousand five hundred years ago these are ancient dice made out of sheep snuckles right before we had awesome game controllers we had sheep snuckles and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings

of visual effects of siji effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in siji and the main characters that all be a siegy and the world would be in siji and
you heard of that okay good so we have some gamers among us so an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination
of being trapped and data we might actually extract information and instead of dealing just with information we can tease out knowledge and we get the knowledge that maybe these from there 's wisdom to be found so with that i thank you
we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places in all wondrous world that we could never really have

gamers love to be attached to all inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories so just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so you all know wikipedia

as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means and in many sort of post human futures that that that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these these
and this reasonable people can disagree is when you have something that 's not economic and you 're trying to fund that that to me mostly is waste unless you 're very close and you 're just funding the learning curb and it 's going to get very cheap i believe we should try more
well again it should have the two elements we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions the less we emit the less that some will be of co2 and therefore the less the temperature but in some ways the grade we get there
they 're lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a months there are about six hundred thousand
we don 't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there 's no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know for a very
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives
and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i 'm going to park my day job as a hollywood moviemaker and i 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while
so let 's think how should we measure ourselves what should our report card look like well let 's go out to where we really need to get and then look at the intermediate for two thousand and fifty you 've heard many people talk about
it 's been constantly going up it 's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors
and we 're getting what we need from games but it doesn 't have to end there this is really exciting according to heroitis after eighteen years the famine wasn 't getting better so the king decided they would play one final byscame
where you have to get the miracle by a certain date usually you just kind of stand by and some come along some don 't this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline
and the third is it 's the focusing illusion and it 's the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap there is just no way of getting it light
factor of one hundred better than the approaches we have now it 's not impossible but it 's not a very easy thing now this shows up when you try to get the intermittance source to be above say twenty to thirty percent
